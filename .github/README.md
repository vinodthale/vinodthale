# Hi there, I'm Vinod Thale 👋

## 👨‍🔬 About Me

I'm a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) researcher passionate about code development and open-source simulation. My main focus is on multiphase and interfacial flows, including drop and bubble dynamics. I enjoy developing and applying numerical methods — especially the Volume of Fluid (VOF) method — to solve challenging multiphase problems.
